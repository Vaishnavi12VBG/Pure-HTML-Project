                            Kota Kachori from Rajasthan is probably the most famous kachori in the state. The Pyaaj Kachori (onion kachori) is also very popular. Another form of Kachori in Jodhpur is the Mawa Kachori, invented by the late Rawat Deora. It is a sweet dish dipped in sugar syrup.
                            
                            In Gujarat, it is usually a round ball made of flour and dough filled with a stuffing of yellow moong dal, black pepper, red chili powder, and ginger paste.
                            
                            In Delhi it is often served as chaat. Delhi also has another kind of kachori, called 'Khasta kachori' or 'Raj Kachori' (fast) kachori, made with potato, coconut, and sugar. Kachoris are often served with a chutney made from tamarind, mint, or coriander. Another type is fried and stuffed with pulses (urad and moong especially) and is generally found in the Kutch region of Gujarat.</td>

                             Cookbook: Idli
                              Media: Idli
                            Idli or idly (/ɪdliː/ (listen)) is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in Eastern and Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.
                            
                            Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan</td>
